Experience Replay incurs higher memory consumption and risks privacy preservation
Alternative is to use shared validation dataset of previous dataset to constraint updates with new dataset
1. Use it during the Bayesian Optimization of the aggregation phase of each round, to pick the combination of weights that achieves best result on new and old dataset
2. Retrain the global model after each aggregation with the validation dataset of previous dataset, on the central server, to alleviate forgetting
